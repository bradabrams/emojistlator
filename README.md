This repo contains a tutorial that walks through use of Managed VMs and the new gcloud SDK for a Java app, based on an extended version of the "guestbook" app. It shows how you can test Managed VMs locally, as well as deploy using the new SDK; and shows how to "escape the sandbox" and use a non-default `Dockerfile`.

See the tutorial 'java_mvms_tutorial' in this directory.
